## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd practice
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

#### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to the `main` branch.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
4. Push your code to the `main` branch
5. The workflow will automatically build and deploy your app
6. Your app will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/practice/`

#### Method 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will build the app and deploy it to the `gh-pages` branch.

**Important:** Make sure to update the `base` property in `vite.config.js` if your repository name is different from "practice":

```javascript
base: '/your-repo-name/',
```
